Program: A Program is a set of instructions written 
in a programming language that tells the computer
how to perform a specific task.

ex: MS words is a program that allows users 
    to create and edit documents.

Process : A process is an instance of a program that is 
        being executed. when a program runs. 
        the OS creates a process to manage its execution.

When we open MS word it becomes a process in the OS.

Thread : A thread is a smallest unit of execution with in the process.
A process can have multiple threads which share the same resource but can run independently.

ex: A web browser like google chrome might use multiple thread for different tabs,
with each tab running as separate thread.


Multitasking: Multi tasking allows and operating system to run multiple process simultaneously,
              On single core cpu, this is done through time sharing rapidly switching between the tasks

On multi core CPUs true parallel execution occurs with tasks distributed across cores,
The OS schedular balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance.

Example: we are browsing the internet while listing the songs and download some files.

Benifites of multitasking :
        Multi tasking utilizes the capabilities of a CPU and its cores, when and operating system
        performs multitasking it can assign different tasks to the different cores that is more efficient
        than assigning all task to single core.

Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple thread within a single process concurrently.

Ex: A web browser can use multithreading by having separate threads for rendering page, javaScript
and managing user inputs, this makes a browser more responsive and efficient.
